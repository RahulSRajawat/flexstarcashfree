                 Like many Web sites, this site actively collects information from <?php echo $name; ?> visitors by permitting
                  you to communicate directly with us via e-mail and feedback forms. Some of the information
                   that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can 
                   be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, 
                   phone number, and so on).<br>
                  Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit
                   from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, order processing, submitting
                    a resume). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is
                     required and what information is optional.

                 As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively collected
                  (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various 
                  technologies and means, such as navigational data collection.<br>

                 This site may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned 
                 to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is
                  generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases
                   an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather 
                   than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We may use your IP address
                    to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the
                     fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, administer and 
                     improve the site.

                 Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information

                  you do so at your own risk. Once we have received your transmission, we will use our 
                  best efforts to ensure <?php echo $name; ?> security on our systems.
